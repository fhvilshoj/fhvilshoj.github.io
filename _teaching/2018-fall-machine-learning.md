Personal feedback from students in my class:
1. He's a great TA; very knowledgeable, approachable and great at explaining.
1. Very good teacher, very patient with people who didn't understand the topics. Good at formulating the complex stuff. Super nice guy, good teacher overall!
1. Frederik was exceptional good.
1. Frederik - he was very good and competent.
1. I was very pleased with my student teacher: Frederik Hvilshøj.
1. ... specielt vore TØ instruktor Frederik, var god til at få alle med, og give sig tid til at hjælpe selvom det var efter TØ timen. (Translation: ... especially our TA Frederik did a great job on getting everyone onboard and he took his time to help even though the lessons were over.)

The [Pattern Recognition and Predictive Modelling in Neuroscience](https://sdc.university/files/Masters-programmes-pages/course-catalogue-spring-2020.pdf) course at the Sino-Danish Center (SDC) in Beijing is an introductory Machine Learning course for neuro-students. It covers concepts like regression, classification, clustering and dimensionality reduction.

SDC is located at UCAS' Yanqihu Campus north of Beijing. It is a partnership between all eight Danish universities, the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences.
During the course, I was supposed to teach practical MatLab exercises but due to the COVID-19 virus, I never got to go to China to teach. Instead, I prepared, supervised, and corrected the exam assignments together with Prof. [Peter Mondrup Rasmussen](https://pure.au.dk/portal/en/persons/peter-mondrup-rasmussen(3db261e0-0cd8-4c3a-8fa5-e186ed61afbe).html).

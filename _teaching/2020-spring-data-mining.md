The [Data Mining Course](https://kursuskatalog.au.dk/en/course/95439/Data-Mining) at Aarhus University was a brand new course, which covered topics like (subspace) clustering, outlier detection, spectral graph theory, graph mining and pattern mining.

As the course was all new and I was the only TA of the course, I produced all the exercise material in collaboration with the professors.
The exercises (and hand-ins) are available [online](https://github.com/fhvilshoj/dm20_exercises).

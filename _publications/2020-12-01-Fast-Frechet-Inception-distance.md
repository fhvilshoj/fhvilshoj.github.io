The Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) has been used to evaluate thousands of generative models. 
We present a novel algorithm, FastFID, which allows fast computation and backpropagation for FID. 
FastFID can efficiently (1) evaluate generative model _during_ training and (2) construct adversarial 
examples for FID.

The Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) has been used to evaluate thousands of generative models. 
We present a novel algorithm, FastFID, which allows fast computation and backpropagation for FID. 
FastFID computes the true FID value but is faster than previous algorithms; in theory and practice. It is even fast enough to train GANs directly with FID as a loss.

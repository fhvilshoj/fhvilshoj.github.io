The first "real" day on NeurIPS has been like a warm up. There has
been three tutorial sessions followed by two invited talks. I have
not been bussy at all.

I just sat down at the first tutorial talk that I wanted to hear, 
when I saw [Lior Kamma](http://pure.au.dk/portal/en/persons/id(08534873-08a0-496b-a7c3-aad4a2dc4a75).html)
 and [Casper Freksen](http://pure.au.dk/portal/en/persons/id(646aa065-8d85-4315-b4c3-4d3a0667ec99).html) 
walking passed me two meteres ahead of me. I joined them and we 
followed each other most of the day, as none of the tutorials 
was of particular interest for any of us. 

From the morning, we heard a talk about networks that could be made
robust to adversarial attacks (Guess it relates to this article [[1]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.00851.pdf)). Even bounds for the generalization
error on new data (at most $\epsilon$ away from the images in the 
training set for some measure $L_p$) had a proven worst case, which
was pretty cool. Afterwards, we heard an other talk about fairness
of models, which was in a room with very bad acoustics. We didn't 
get much from that talk. Then we heard a talk by [Susan Athey](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/faculty/susan-athey) from Stanford that I personally had 
very high expectations to, as it was on the topic 'Counterfactual
Inference'. However, she never really got into the flesh of the topic
and so I didn't really learn anything new from that talk. It was mostly
about RCTs, Diff-in-diff, etc. from econometrics, which I already knew.

Being a bit tiered of talks, I went to collect some swag with Lior and
Casper. I got t-shits, a scarf, a cap, an expensive pen, a thermo bottle
and some stickers:

Finally, we heard the opening talk of the conference and a talk by the 
CEO of Atipica, Laura Gomez, before we went out to get something to eat.

I have been bouncing around the expo today. The expo has multiple tracks. 

1. Stands by all the big players in AI; Facebook, Google, NVIDIA, etc. 
2. A 'Talks & Panels' track, where different companies present different
	 research.
3. A 'Workshop' track
4. A 'Demo' track

General for all the tracks today is that it is driven by businesses and not
just researchers. I have been at the stands and to two presentations. Here,
I will discuss what I saw today.

### Stands
At the stands, I didn't find too much interesting stuff. The only thing that
was really interesting to me was [Quantumblack](https://www.quantumblack.com/).
This is a child company of [McKinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/). It seems thay
they are solving some really cool problems for some large industrial players.
The thing that interested me more, however, was that it seems that you will be
imployed in positions where you are doing exactly what you are good at. That is,
they employ individual people for front-end, data science, machine learning, 
backend, etc. This makes it very interesting for me. Of course, the name also
has a positive impact.

### Talks & Panels
I went to a talk on producing medicin using GAN's, RL and a lot of probabilistic
modelling. I entered the presentation half way through, so I didn't get so much
from it. 

Secondly, I saw a panel discussion on entrepreneur ship hosted by [Next AI](http://www.nextcanada.com/next-ai).
Here, the founders of three different AI start-ups answered questions. The discussion
it self was not that interesting. What I gained most value of was seeing what
Next AI does. It is a really cool incubator for AI startups. However, it is 
located in Canada so thats quite a catch.

I do research in Deep Learning. Specifically, I am very interested in invertible Neural Networks and Explainable Deep Learning. I believe that the two directions of research can be joined in a fruitful way.

Currently, I am a PhD student at the [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.au.dk) at [Aarhus University](https://www.au.dk). I am a part of the [Data-Intensive Systems Group](https://cs.au.dk/research/data-intensive-systems/), which is lead by my supervisor prof. [Ira Assent](https://pure.au.dk/portal/en/persons/ira-assent(012c1c28-bfa9-4107-bd8f-97dae008b06d).html). Previously, I obtained both my bachelor's and master's degree from Aarhus University. During my master's degree, I studied both at the [Technical University of Denmark](https://www.dtu.dk) and at [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu).

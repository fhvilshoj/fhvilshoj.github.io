I gave a talk about Machine Learning at Aarhus University. 
I spent 45 minutes on convincing high-school students that what they learn in math is cool.
The talk (with [these slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1TdJtMOHdeGwbL_AKJ35pBQZKy2M1qp-m1Co_egnLiSA/edit?usp=sharing)) covered the basic idea about loss-functions and gradient descent on a simple data set generated from a 4th-order polynomial and then it motivated how we can use such tricks to train deep neural networks.

I have included a tiny gif that I showed the attendees during the slides:
